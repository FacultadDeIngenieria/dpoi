# Structured Data
D.P.O.I.

# Linked Data

Linked Data empowers people that publish and use information on the Web.

It is a way to create a network of standards-based, machine-readable data across Web sites.

It allows an application to start at one piece of Linked Data, and follow embedded links to other pieces of Linked Data that are hosted on different sites across the Web.

# Linked Data / Structured Data

Linked Data is a method of publishing Structured Data so that it can be interlinked and become more useful through semantic queries.

It builds upon standard Web technologies such as HTTP, RDF and URIs, but rather than using them to serve web pages for human readers, it extends them to share information in a way that can be read automatically by computers.

# Structured Data on the Web

Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page content.

Search engines, web crawlers, and browsers can extract and process Structured Data from a web page and use it to provide a richer browsing experience for users.

For example, on a recipe page, what are the ingredients, the cooking time and temperature, the calories, and so on.

# Vocabularies

Vocabularies define the concepts and relationships (also referred to as “terms”) used to describe and represent an area of concern.

Vocabularies are used to classify the terms that can be used in a particular application, characterize possible relationships, and define possible constraints on using those terms.

In practice, vocabularies can be very complex (with several thousands of terms) or very simple (describing one or two concepts only).
